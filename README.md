A sample application using apx mvc library - https://github.com/othreecodes/APX


## What is This
- This is a demo using apx library to create a beautiful desktop app. It follows the MVC standard of creating javafx projects.
- This also includes a sample of how to use ORMlite to access mysql database. (Querying and Creating)


## Getting Started
 1. Clone the Repo
 2. Download APX library from [Here](https://github.com/othreecodes/APX/releases) For your corresponding Operating System
 3. Add apx.jar to the projects classpath (importing the library to the project)

## Using as a Starter Project 
  Edit the project.apxprop
  ```json
  
{ 
"name": "apxdemo",
"package": "com.root.apxdemo",
"location": "/root/apxdemo/",
"src": "/root/apxdemo/src/",
"work": "/root/apxdemo/src/com/root/apxdemo/"
}
  ```
  edit the location, and work to match location of the project on your system.
  It might get a bit tricky changing package names of all source files even if you
  just copy the src files to your own project. Thats why this is a "DEMO"
